# Serverless-Web-Application

Project Description:

In this project, we will build a serverless web application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, and S3. The application will allow users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) items from a DynamoDB table through a RESTful API.

Steps to Build the Project:

Use S3 to store and host the web application's static files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript).
Create a DynamoDB table to store the items.
Build a Lambda function to handle the CRUD operations on the DynamoDB table.
Create an API Gateway RESTful API to interact with the Lambda function.
Create a CloudFront distribution to serve the S3-hosted static files with low latency.

Expected Outcome:

Upon completing the project, we will have a working serverless web application hosted on AWS. We will have hands-on experience building a serverless application using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3, CloudFront, and Cognito. Additionally,we will have experience working with AWS services and integrating them to build a complete solution.

This project will help us to improve skills in cloud computing, serverless architecture, and AWS services.
